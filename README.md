#An Online Food Delivery System in Rails for home makers

###Here's what the app is supposed to do

The website allows users to sign up and pay for a subscription to a weekly delivery of meals. A shopping cart is used to allow users to choose meals from a menu for each day of the week.  

The home cook will be selling thier own food, not other restaurants food.

Users choose how many days they want meals for, then choose the meals. 

These are the steps we want to create:

1. People sign up for the account first (i.e. name and email)
2. They then are shown a pre-selected menu to choose from and then they can also choose to customize the menu
3 Users will decide how many meals to order and the delivery days.
4. At the end of this selection, we ask them for their credit card info and delivery address.

We will also require a backend system where we can manage the orders and also manage the register.
